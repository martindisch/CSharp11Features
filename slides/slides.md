# Raw string literals

## Remember these?

```csharp
string multiline_text = @"this is a multiline text
this is " + a1 + @"
this is " + a2 + @"
this is " + a3 + @"";
```

```csharp
var builder = new StringBuilder()
    .AppendLine("this is a multiline text")
    .AppendLine($"this is {a1}")
    .AppendLine($"this is {a2}")
    .AppendLine($"this is {a3}");
```

```csharp
string pattern = @"this is a multiline text
this is {0}
this is {1}
this is {2}";
string result = string.Format(pattern, a1, a2, a3);
```

```csharp
string pattern = $@"this is a multiline text
this is {a1}
this is {a2}
this is {a3}";
```

## This is better

```csharp
var id = 25;

var meep = $"""
<person id="{id}">
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <address kind="home">Market Street 45</address>
</person>
""";
```

- Works with raw curly braces without having to escape them
- Removes newlines after opening and same plus whitespace before closing quote

## Almost ðŸ¦€

```csharp
bool IsPalindrome(char[] characters) => characters switch
{
    [var first, .. var middle, var last] => first == last && IsPalindrome(middle),
    [] or [_] => true,
};
```
